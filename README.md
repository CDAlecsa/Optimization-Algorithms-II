# A comparison between Polyak and Nesterov algorithms for different objective mappings

This a data repository concerning a Python based implementation (created in Spyder) of Polyak and Nesterov algorithms, along with graphical representations of the following :
- contour plots of the given function (only for 2D)
- energy and iterates decay for the algorithms
- iteration bins for the two algorithms

Objective mappings : 
- a 1D convex function
- Booth
- McCormik
- exponential function
- Schwefel 2.23
- Rastrigin
- Sum squares function

Optimization algorithms that are included in this repository :
- Polyak 
- Nesterov

One can modify the inertial coefficients of these algorithms inside their numerical implementation and the given parameters that are set 
to some default values.
